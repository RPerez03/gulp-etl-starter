# gulp-etl-starter #

This starter project is a **gulp-etl** project that performs ETL tasks using [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). You can debug in [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
or run from the command line as a regular gulp task

### Quick Start
* Dependencies: 
    * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) - At least v6.3 (6.9 for Windows) required for TypeScript debugging
    * npm (installs with Node)
    * typescript - installed as a development dependency
* Clone this repo and run `npm install` to install npm packages
* Debug: with [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) use `Open Folder` to open the project folder, then hit F5 to debug. This runs without compiling to javascript using [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)
* Test: `npm test` or `npm t`
* Compile TypeScript to javascript: `npm run build`
* Run javascript version: gulp --gulpfile gulpfile.js default
* Run TypeScript version: gulp --gulpfile gulpfile.ts processCsv
